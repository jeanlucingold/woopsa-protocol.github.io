		<p>Woopsa is based on solid foundations everybody knows, so it takes very little effort to use it in your own applications.</p>
		<p>All it takes to understand what Woopsa can do is to take a look at our <a href="/get-started/">"get started" guide</a> and then take a look at the simple UML model.</p>
		<p>Once you've got that figured out, you can dig a bit deeper and read our <a href="https://github.com/woopsa-protocol">source code</a> &mdash; it's free as freedom!</p>
		<p>If you're interested, you can also read the <a href="/specifications/">complete specifications</a> to the protocol!</p>

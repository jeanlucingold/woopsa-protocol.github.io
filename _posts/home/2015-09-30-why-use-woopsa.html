<h1>Why use Woopsa?</h1>
<div class="row">

	<!-- TODO CHECK ENGLISH -->
		<dt>It makes you ready for the Industry 4.0 revolution.</dt>
		<dd>When simplicity also means power. Aside from reading/writing values and calling methods, Woopsa also supports multiple requests and the publish-subscribe pattern as native extensions. This makes polling a thing of the past, and allows you to communicate in real-time with very low bandwidth overhead.</dd>
		<dt>Get started in less than 5 minutes.</dt>
		<dd>Sure, you could roll out your own RESTful API, imagine which methods and data your application needs to expose and then write both the client &mdash; and server &mdash; side of your application. Save time by using Woopsa: you can immediately get properties and call methods on your model, with virtually zero effort.</dd>
		<dt>It's super simple stuff.</dt>
		<dd>Woopsa is an Internet of Things protocol that brings all the communication mechanisms you need for your connected applications : explore the model, read/write properties, invoke methods, publish/subscribe notifications and perform multiple requests at once.	
		All these services are implemented simply using JSON over HTTP, making it also usable in web browsers natively. Woopsa can also be used as a simpler protocol that answers  the common needs of OPC-UA users, making it a viable open, free and simple alternative for many applications. </dd>

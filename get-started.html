    <h1>Using the C# / .NET server</h1>
    <h2 id="csharp-server-introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Making a Woopsa server is extremely simple and requires just <strong>one</strong> line of code if you're using our reflector! Just give the Woopsa server a class and it will do the rest, automagically!</p>
    <p>The C# / .NET server is included in the <samp>Woopsa</samp> assembly. We created the Woopsa library with Mono in mind, trying to use only the most standard .NET components for maximum compatibility.</p>
    
    <h2 id="csharp-server-getting-the-assembly-and-using-it">Getting the assembly and using it</h2>
    <p>Start off by <a href="/download/">downloading</a> Woopsa and get the Woopsa.dll assembly inside the DotNet folder. Add this assembly as a reference in your Visual Studio project and add the following line to the top of your source file:</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight csharp %}
using Woopsa;
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <p>That's it! You're now ready to create your server.</p>
    
    <h2 id="csharp-server-creating-your-first-server">Creating your first server</h2>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> By default, the Woopsa server resides on <strong>port 80</strong> and has a base path of <samp>/woopsa</samp>, meaning your first server will be available from <samp>http://localhost/woopsa</samp></p>
    <p>To create a simple server, you first need some data to publish to the world. You can set your Woopsa server to handle any C# object, but for example's sake, this is the class we are going to use:</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight csharp %}
public class WeatherStation
{
  public double Temperature { get; private set; }

  public double Sensitivity { get; set; }

  public string GetWeatherAtDate(DateTime date)
  {
    switch (date.DayOfWeek)
    {
      case DayOfWeek.Monday:
        return "cloudy";
      default:
        return "sunny";
    }
  }
}
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
	<p>Once you've written your class, you can simply create the new Woopsa server and give it your root object:</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight csharp %}
WeatherStation station = new WeatherStation();
WoopsaServer server = new WoopsaServer(station);
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
	<p>That's it! Your Woopsa server is now available on <samp>http://localhost/woopsa</samp>. The server starts in its own thread and uses a thread pool to serve multiple clients at once. This means you really don't have to worry about anything ... just work with your <samp>WeatherStation</samp> like you would with any other object, and Woopsa takes care of everything for you. Including publish/subscribe events!</p>
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Woopsa is completely web-based. This means you can see your data simply with a browser! Go on <samp>http://localhost/woopsa/meta/</samp> too see the metadata of your root object, or <samp>http://localhost/woopsa/read/Temperature</samp> to read a piece of data!</p>
	
	<h2 id="csharp-server-going-deeper-with-the-server">Going deeper with the server</h2>
	<h3 id="csharp-server-publishing-only-part-of-your-model">Publishing only part of your model</h3>
	<p>You'll have noticed that the server you just created is not exactly like the one on our demo server (<samp>http://demo.woopsa.org/woopsa</samp>). Most notably, the <samp>ToString()</samp> and <samp>GetHashCode()</samp> methods are published, even though they're not in your class!</p>
	<p>This is because these two methods are common to all classes in .NET, and they're both public. Since by default the Woopsa object reflector (the thing that transforms any class into a <samp>WoopsaObject</samp>) publishes every public property and method, these methods are published.</p>
	<p>If, for any reason, you would not like to publish these methods, or you simply want to choose what to publish, you can! There are two metadata attributes you can use in C# to accomplish this.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><samp>[WoopsaVisible(true)]</samp> Applies to properties, fields and methods. This tells the reflector to publish this item. <strong>Note:</strong> these attributes are ignored if the <samp>[WoopsaVisbility(WoopsaObjectAdapterVisibility.WoopsaVisible)]</samp> isn't present in the class.</li>
		<li><samp>[WoopsaVisbility(WoopsaObjectAdapterVisibility.WoopsaVisible)]</samp> Applies to classes. Just put this attribute on your class and <samp>[WoopsaVisible(true)]</samp> will be taken into account.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In summary, this is what your new class should look like:</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight csharp %}
[WoopsaVisbility(WoopsaObjectAdapterVisibility.WoopsaVisible)]
public class WeatherStation
{
  [WoopsaVisible(true)]
  public double Temperature { get; private set; }

  [WoopsaVisible(true)]
  public double Sensitivity { get; set; }

  [WoopsaVisible(true)]
  public string GetWeatherAtDate(DateTime date)
  {
    switch (date.DayOfWeek)
    {
      case DayOfWeek.Monday:
        return "cloudy";
      default:
        return "sunny";
    }
  }
}
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
	
	<h3 id="csharp-server-working-with-a-complete-hierarchy">Working with a complete hierarchy</h3>
	<p>The reflector works very well, even with nested objects. However, for performance reasons, the object tree is only explored on creation. This means that if you change the embedded objects in your classes, the new data won't be available until you call the <samp>ClearCache</samp> method.</p>
	<p>Here's an example of using embedded objects and where things might go wrong:</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight csharp %}
public class SmokeDetector
{
  public bool SmokeDetected { get; private set; }
}

public class VentilationSystem
{  
  public VentilationSystem()
  {
    SmokeDetector = new SmokeDetector();
  }
  
  public bool Power { get; private set; }

  public SmokeDetector SmokeDetector { get; set; }
}

...

VentilationSystem system = new VentilationSystem();
WoopsaServer server = new WoopsaServer(system);

...

system.SmokeDetector = new SmokeDetector(); // This won't update the server!
server.ClearCache(); // Now it works again
    {% endhighlight %}
	</div>
	<p>That's it! If you want to know more about how to use the server, please take a look at some of the examples available in the source code. You can also read the <a href="/specifications/">full specifications</a> of the Woopsa protocol to get a better understanding of how everything works!</p>
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Try not to clear the cache too often as it will drastically reduce performance.</p>
	
	<h3 id="csharp-server-using-ssl-tls">Using SSL/TLS</h3>
	<p>Because Woopsa is based on HTTP, adding SSL/TLS is a breeze! You just need to specify port 443, add a certificate and you're good-to-go. The internal <samp>WebServer</samp> (Woopsa's own lightweight HTTP server) has a concept called <em>Pre-route Processing</em> which allows it to manipulate the data stream before the actual HTTP route handling is done. This makes adding SSL/TLS as easy as adding a <samp>TlsProcessor</samp> to the <samp>WebServer</samp>'s <samp>PreRouteProcessors</samp>:
    {% highlight csharp %}
WeatherStation station = new WeatherStation();
WoopsaServer server = new WoopsaServer(station, 443);
server.WebServer.PreRouteProcessors.Add(new TlsProcessor("{path-to-your-certificate.p12}","{private-key-password}"))
    {% endhighlight %}
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Internally, this processor uses .NET's <samp>SslStream</samp> and <samp>X509Certificate2</samp> coupled with <samp>AuthenticateAsServer()</samp>. This means that the certificate you pass to the processor must be a PKCS12 package with a password-protected private key embedded in it. Creating certificates is not related to Woopsa and is not covered in this guide.</p>

	<h3 id="csharp-server-using-authentication">Using authentication</h3>
	<p>Because Woopsa is based on HTTP, authentication is done with the simple WWW-Authenticate mechanism. This means that clients wishing to connect to your authentication-enabled Woopsa server will need to provide the <samp>Authorization</samp> header with proper Base64-encoded credentials.</p>
	<p>To enable authentication on the server, you simply need to give the server a <samp>delegate bool WWWAuthenticator.Check(string username, string password)</samp> through the <samp>CheckAuthenticate</samp> property. You can then check against this username and password as you wish, and return <samp>true</samp> on success or <samp>false</samp> on failure.</p>
	<p>To disable authentication on the server, simply set <samp>CheckAuthenticate</samp> to <samp>null</samp> (which is the case by default).</p>
    {% highlight csharp %}
WeatherStation root = new WeatherStation();
WoopsaServer woopsaServer = new WoopsaServer(root, 80);
woopsaServer.CheckAuthenticate = delegate(string username, string password)
{
  if (username == "admin" && password == "password")
    return true;
  else
    return false;
};
	{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Of course, SSL/TLS and authentication work together seamlessly and thus allow full server and client-side authentication. That's the magic of using standardS!</p>

    <h1>Using the JavaScript client</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Our official JavaScript client is the easiest way to get started using Woopsa in a web application. Contrary to most other protocols out there, you <strong>do not need a gateway server</strong>. Indeed, because Woopsa is based on HTTP, browsers can directly connect to Woopsa servers. This is great in many aspects, because it means there are less possible points of failure which makes for a much simpler infrastructure!</p>
    
    <h2 id="javascript-client-getting-the-code">Getting the code</h2>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The Woopsa JavaScript library depends on <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for making asynchronous requests.</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="{your-javascript-folder}/woopsa-client.min.js"/>
        {% endhighlight %}
        </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2 id="javascript-client-creating-your-first-client">Creating your first client</h2>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Woopsa is connection-less. This means that creating a client does not initiate any data exchange until requests are actually made.</p>
    <p>Creating a new Woopsa client is easy. You just need to know the URL of the server, and pass jQuery as a dependency. Then you're ready to make your first requests! Because we want to help you get started as quickly as possible, we host a free sample Woopsa server on <samp>http://demo.woopsa.org/woopsa</samp>. To tell Woopsa to communicate with this server, use the following code to create a new client:</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight javascript %}
var client = new WoopsaClient("http://demo.woopsa.org/woopsa", jQuery);
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <p>That's it! You're now ready to make your first requests.</p>
    
    <h2 id="javascript-client-basic-usage">Basic usage</h2>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> our JavaScript library implements the Promise interface, which means <samp>done</samp>, <samp>fail</samp> and <samp>always</samp> are available for you!</p>
    <p>Woopsa has 4 basic verbs that allow you to do everything you need! The three verbs are presented below, along with the code examples that go with them:</p>
    
    <h3 id="javascript-client-exploring-the-object-tree-with-meta">Exploring the object tree with <samp>meta</samp></h3>
    <p>Because Woopsa is object-oriented, you can freely explore the data that's available on the server. This allows you to write very flexible clients that can fetch data based on what they're presented with. Fetching the object hierarchy is as simple as specifying the path and a callback method:</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight javascript %}
client.meta("/", function (tree){
  console.log(tree);
});
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <div class="output">

    <p>If you want to learn more about the meaning of all this stuff, read the <a href="/specifications/">full specifications</a> to the Woopsa protocol!</p>
    
    <h3 id="javascript-client-reading-a-property-with-read">Reading a property with <samp>read</samp></h3>
    <p>You can make a request to read a property by using the simple <samp>read</samp> function provided to you in the library. This method only requires 2 parameters: the path of the property and a callback method for when the value is returned by the server.</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight javascript %}
client.read("/Temperature", function (value){
  console.log("The temperature is " + value);
});
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <div class="output">
    {% highlight text %}
The temperature is 24.2
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    
    <h3 id="javascript-client-writing-to-a-property-with-write">Writing to a property with <samp>write</samp></h3>
    <p>Writing properties is as easy as reading them. Watch out though, because properties have a type and may be read-only! The write method requires 3 parameters: the path of the property, the value to write and a callback function (optional) for when the value is writting to the server.</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight javascript %}
client.write("/Sensitivity", 0.5, function (response){
  if ( response == true ){
    console.log("The value was written successfully!");
  }else{
    console.log("The value was not written successfully :(");
  }
})
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <div class="output">
    {% highlight text %}
The value was written successfully!
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    
    <h3 id="javascript-client-calling-a-method-function-with-invoke">Calling a method/function with <samp>invoke</samp></h3>
    <p>Methods in Woopsa allow you to send commands to the server in a more intuitive way. Again, this is very easily done with Woopsa. The invoke method requires 3 parameters: the path of the method, the arguments and a callback for when the method has been called on the server.</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight javascript %}
client.invoke("/GetWeatherAtDate", new Date(2015, 9, 6), function (response){
  console.log(response);
})
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <div class="output">

    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    
    <h2 id="javascript-client-listening-for-value-changes">Listening for value changes (publish/subscribe)</h2>
    <p>On servers that support it, a <samp>SubscriptionService</samp> object is available at the root. This object has various methods to subscribe to value changes. However, the library abstracts this away for you! An easy-to-use <samp>onChange</samp> method allows you to bind a callback to the change of a property. All you need to provide it is a path and a callback.</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight javascript %}
client.onChange("/Temperature", function (value){
  console.log(value);
})
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <div class="output">
    {% highlight text %}
24.2
..
24.3
..
24.1
..
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <p>If you wish to have more control over the rate at which events are raised, or just want to learn a bit more about how the publish/subscribe pattern is implemented in Woopsa, go read the <a href="/specifications/">full specifications</a>! </p>
	
	<h3 id="javascript-client-using-ssl-tls">Using SSL/TLS</h3>
	<p>Under the hood, the Woopsa JavaScript client uses the standard XmlHttpRequest. This means that using it with an SSL/TLS enabled server is just a matter of using <samp>https://</samp> instead of <samp>http://</samp> when specifying the server URL.</p>
    {% highlight csharp %}
var client = new WoopsaClient("https://demo.woopsa.org/woopsa");
    {% endhighlight %}
	
	<h3 id="javascript-client-using-authentication">Using authentication</h3>
	<p>If the Woopsa server you are communicating with requires client authentication with a username and password, simply set the <samp>username</samp> and <samp>password</samp> properties of your client and all future requests will be authenticated.</p>
	{% highlight javascript %}

Because we want to help you get started as quickly as possible, we host a free sample Woopsa server on <samp>http://demo.woopsa.org/woopsa</samp>. To tell Woopsa to communicate with this server, use the following code to create a new client:</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight csharp %}
WoopsaClient client = new WoopsaClient("http://demo.woopsa.org/woopsa");
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <p>That's it! You're now ready to work with your server.</p>
    
    <h2 id="csharp-client-basic-usage">Basic usage</h2>
    <p>The C# / .NET library abstracts away a lot of the workings of Woopsa. It works differently from the JavaScript implementation, making use of all the powerful features that the C# language and .NET platform have to offer.</p>
    
    <h3 id="csharp-client-exploring-the-object-tree">Exploring the object tree</h3>
    <p>The Woopsa client publishes a <samp>Root</samp> object which implements the <samp>IWoopsaObject</samp> interface. This object is filled on-demand with all the published properties, methods and items on the server as <samp>IEnumerable</samp> properties. This means that you can simply iterate through these properties to know exactly what's on the server, without any additional logic!</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight csharp %}
foreach (var property in client.Root.Properties)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Property {0} : {1} ({2})", property.Name, property.Type, property.IsReadOnly);
}
foreach (var method in client.Root.Methods)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Method {0} : {1}", method.Name, method.ReturnType);
  foreach (WoopsaMethodArgumentInfo argument in method.ArgumentInfos)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Argument {0} : {1}", argument.Name, argument.Type);
  }
}
foreach (var obj in client.Root.Items)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Item {0}", obj.Name);
}
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <div class="output">
    {% highlight text %}
Property Temperature : Real (True)
Property Sensitivity : Real (False)
Method MultiRequest : JsonData
Argument Requests : JsonData
Method GetWeatherAtDate : String
Argument Date : DateTime
Item SubscriptionService
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    
    <h3 id="csharp-client-reading-a-property">Reading a property</h3>
    <p>Because they implement the <samp>IWoopsaProperty</samp> interface, reading a value is as easy as accessing the <samp>Value</samp> of your property! The library takes care of most cases of typecasting.</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight csharp %}
Console.WriteLine("Temperature = {0}", client.Root.Properties.ByName("Temperature").Value);
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <div class="output">
    {% highlight text %}
Temperature = 24.2
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    
    <h3 id="csharp-client-writing-to-a-property">Writing to a property</h3>
    <p>When you wish to write a property, you need to know its type in order to assign it a <samp>WoopsaValue</samp>. Once you know this, writing is a simple as assigning something to the <samp>Value</samp> property.</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight csharp %}
client.Root.Properties.ByName("Sensitivity").Value = new WoopsaValue(0.5);
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The Woopsa .NET library comes with tons of premade <samp>WoopsaValue</samp> constructors that accept just about any type you can think of, making your life easier when dealing with <samp>WoopsaValue</samp>s.</p>
    
    <h3 id="csharp-client-calling-a-method-function">Calling a method/function</h3>
    <p>When you have your method, simply call <samp>Invoke</samp> on the <samp>WoopsaMethod</samp>, passing it a list of <samp>WoopsaValue</samp>s.
	<div class="code">
    {% highlight csharp %}
string weather = client.Root.Methods.ByName("GetWeatherAtDate").Invoke(
  new List<WoopsaValue>()
  {
    new WoopsaValue(DateTime.Now)
  }
);
Console.WriteLine(weather);
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <div class="output">
    {% highlight text %}
cloudy
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> While the JavaScript implementation of invoke has named parameters, this is not the case in the C# version. This means that the order in which you specify arguments is important!</p>

    <h2 id="csharp-client-listening-for-value-changes">Listening for value changes</h2>
    <p><samp>WoopsaClientProperty</samp> has a useful <samp>Change</samp> event that you can subscribe to.</p>
    <div class="code">
    {% highlight csharp %}
client.Root.Properties.ByName("Temperature").Change += Temperature_Changed;
...
private void Temperature_Changed(object sender, WoopsaNotificationEventArgs e)
{
  Console.WriteLine(e.Value);
}
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <div class="output">
    {% highlight text %}
24.2
..
24.3
..
24.1
..
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <h3 id="csharp-client-even-simpler-using-the-dynamic-client">Even simpler: using the dynamic client</h3>
    <p>The steps presented above allow you to write strict object-oriented code with strong typing and compilation-time checking. However, the notation can be somewhat tedious at times. This is why we also created a dynamic client, which allows you to talk to a Woopsa server as if it were a regular object!</p>
<div class="code">
    {% highlight csharp %}
dynamic client = new WoopsaDynamicClient("http://demo.woopsa.org/woopsa");
//Reading a property
Console.WriteLine("Temperature = {0}", client.Temperature);
//Writing a property
client.Sensitivity = 0.5;
//Invoking a method
Console.WriteLine("Weather = {0}", client.GetWeatherAtDate(DateTime.Now));
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <div class="output">
    {% highlight text %}
Temperature = 24.2
Weather = cloudy
    {% endhighlight %}  
    </div>
	
	<h3 id="csharp-client-using-ssl-tls">Using SSL/TLS</h3>
	<p>Under the hood, the Woopsa C# client uses <samp>HttpWebRequest</samp>. This means that using it with an SSL/TLS enabled server is just a matter of using <samp>https://</samp> instead of <samp>http://</samp> when specifying the server URL.</p>
    {% highlight csharp %}
WoopsaClient client = new WoopsaClient("https://localhost/woopsa");
    {% endhighlight %}
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Certificate validation will be handled by the .NET platform's own internals. This is out of the scope of this guide, however, a "quick and dirty" way to avoid errors when testing out on local servers with self-signed certificates is to add a <samp>RemoteCertificateValidationCallback</samp> to the <samp>ServicePointManager</samp>:<br><br>
	<samp>ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback += (sender, cert, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true;</samp>
	<br><br>
	<strong>Warning:</strong> This will override all the certificate validation chain and won't authentify the server! It's always recommended to get a proper certificate for your server instead.</p>
	
	<h3 id="csharp-client-using-authentication">Using authentication</h3>
	<p>If the Woopsa server you are communicating with requires client authentication with a username and password, simply set the <samp>Username</samp> and <samp>Password</samp> properties of your client (works on the dynamic client as well) and all future requests will be authenticated.</p>
	{% highlight csharp %}
WoopsaClient client = new WoopsaClient("http://demo.woopsa.org/woopsa");
client.Username = "admin";
client.Password = "password";
	{% endhighlight %}
